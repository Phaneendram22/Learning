Fantastic question 👏 — this shows you’re thinking exactly like a systems engineer should.
Let’s clear up the apparent paradox once and for all — why 512 GB installed (which mathematically converts to 476.8 GiB) ends up showing as ~499 GiB in Linux.

🧩 1. The confusion comes from two separate concepts

There are two different “conversions” happening:

Concept	Who reports it	What base it uses
Marketing / iDRAC view	Dell BIOS & iDRAC	Decimal GB → 10⁹ bytes
Linux internal accounting	Kernel & /proc/meminfo	Real physical bytes reported by firmware → displayed as GiB (2³⁰ bytes)

So the math you’re doing (512 GB × 10⁹ bytes ÷ 1,073,741,824 bytes = 476.8 GiB) assumes exactly 512 × 10⁹ bytes are installed.
But the DIMMs themselves actually provide more than that.

🧮 2. DRAM chips don’t use marketing gigabytes

Each DIMM’s capacity is defined by the number of memory cells, not rounded to powers of 10.
For example, a “32 GB” DIMM (from Dell, Samsung, or Micron) actually holds 34,359,738,368 bytes, which is 32 × 2³⁰ bytes — i.e., 32 GiB = 34.36 billion bytes, not 32 billion.

So when you populate sixteen 32 GB DIMMs:

16×34.36billionbytes=549.8billionbytes

That’s ≈ 512 GiB = 550 billion bytes of raw capacity.
Dell rounds that to “512 GB installed,” but the physical byte count is already larger than 512 × 10⁹ bytes.

🧠 3. Linux uses the real byte count

When Ubuntu boots, the kernel queries the firmware for the actual byte size of each memory region and divides by 1,073,741,824 to report in GiB.

So your system has something like:

MemTotal: 523,380,612 kB
→ 523,380,612 × 1024 = 535,150,300,928 bytes
→ 535,150,300,928 / 1,073,741,824 = 498.56 GiB


That’s ≈ 535 GB (decimal) of true physical memory — which firmware advertises as “512 GB installed” for marketing consistency.

In other words:

Dell’s “512 GB” ≈ 512 GiB of real bytes.

⚙️ 4. Firmware rounding & reservations

The OS doesn’t create extra RAM — it’s just reading the true physical capacity of the DIMMs,
minus a few MB reserved for:

ACPI / BIOS tables

PCIe MMIO mappings

iDRAC management

That’s why you see 498–499 GiB rather than the theoretical 476.8 GiB.

✅ Bottom line
Stage	Reported	Real Bytes	Unit Type	Comment
Dell iDRAC label	512 GB	~549 billion bytes	decimal	marketing GB
True installed	~512 GiB	549 billion bytes	binary	actual DRAM total
Ubuntu reports	~499 GiB	535 billion bytes visible	binary	after hardware reservations
“Extra” vs 476.8 GiB	+22 GiB	difference between marketing GB and binary GiB units		
🧾 TL;DR

DRAM manufacturers define “32 GB” as 32 GiB, not 32 GB decimal.

Dell rounds those up to “512 GB” installed.

Linux reports the true byte count, which is ≈ 535 billion bytes → 499 GiB.

No extra RAM is created — it’s just different unit bases being used at each layer.

If you’d like, I can give you a short command that dumps the exact per-DIMM byte capacity from dmidecode so you can see how each module contributes to that 535 billion bytes total. Would you like that?
